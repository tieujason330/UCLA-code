I was successfully able to fulfill all the following requirements for this assignment. 
There is nothing special required in order to build my project.

Fulfilled:
(a) Implement the composite RotateXYZ(thetaX, thetaY and thetaZ) procedure in Angel/mat.h
without using any elementary transformations; RotateXYZ rotates first around X, then around Y
and finally around Z. (4 Point)
(b) Fix the vertices[8] and colorcube() in shape.cpp. They are used to draw a cube. (1 Point)
(c) You must use a hierarchical approach to model the complex objects. (5 Points)
(d) Model a static ground plane. (1 Point)
(e) Model a tree that has a trunk made of 8 parts and a sphere for foliage. (2 Points)
(f) The tree must visibly sway as shown by the sample executable. (2 Points)
(g) You must rotate objects around the correct point; i.e., where they touch the parent object.
Trunk parts rotate around the middle of the bottom face. (4 Points)
(h) Animate the wings and legs of the wasp. You may use the same value for more than one
angle. The wasp’s main axis is X. All moving body parts must rotate around the X-axis.
(5 Points)
(i) The wasp flies in a circle around the vertical axis, and it should always be aligned with
the tangent of the circle. (3 Points)
(j) The wasp must move up and down. (2 Points)
(k) You need NOT match the exact motion or dimensions of the sample code; however, your
scene must be qualitatively and visually similar to the one provided.
