My animation shows a setting filled with trees and structures.And 
a tunnel filled with traps.
A bird is trying to escape being eaten by a monster-like creature.

Hierarchial objects:
- Bird
   - Had to piece together body and make wings flap
   - Had to move it as a whole
- Trees
   - Had to build a "Christmas looking" tree and move it as a whole
- Setting 1
   - Structure had two pillars and multiple layers of roofing
   - Had to move it as a whole
   - Had forest
- Setting 2
   - 4 separate cube pieces put together to look like a tunnel, moves in unison
   - Traps attached to each cube
- Monster
   - Monster had a top and bottom part representing a mouth that could open and close
   - Had teeth 
   - Whole thing moved as a whole

Within my code, there are different objects (drawArrow(..) and drawTarget(...) that 
were commented out because I decided not to use them. If I hope I'll be able to use
them later on if I decide to without getting punished for possible plagarism ( I created
them myself).
